# Starknet Homepage
This project pays homage to the infamous [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/).

## Overview
Starknet Homepage is a decentralized web application built on the Starknet blockchain. The main idea behind this project is to create a virtual space where users can own and customize small pieces of a 100x100 grid called "Starknet Homepage". Each block represents a 10x10 pixel area, and users can purchase these blocks by minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that they can customize with images and other details.

Starknet Homepage aspires to establish itself as the premier destination for all things related to the Starknet blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging the power of decentralized technology, this innovative project aims to offer a unique and interactive virtual space that fosters creativity, collaboration, and ownership within the Starknet community.

Starknet Homepage goes beyond just being a canvas; it aims to be the go-to hub for the Starknet community. It's a place where developers, artists, and enthusiasts can converge, share their work, discover new projects, and engage in meaningful interactions. From artistic expression to advertising, the platform provides a versatile space for a wide range of activities that encompass the Starknet ecosystem.

By embodying the essence of decentralization and creativity, Starknet Homepage can become a reference point for anyone seeking to explore, contribute to, or experience the diverse landscape of the Starknet blockchain. It's a dynamic fusion of technology, art, and community that showcases the potential of blockchain-based collaboration and ownership in a visually captivating way. 

Just as the Million Dollar Homepage left a mark on the early internet, Starknet Homepage strives to leave a lasting legacy within the world of decentralized applications and blockchain innovation.
