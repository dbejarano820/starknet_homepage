# Starknet Homepage

## Overview

Starknet Homepage is a decentralized web application built on the Starknet blockchain. The main idea behind this project is to create a virtual space where users can own and customize small pieces of a 100x100 grid called "Starknet Homepage". Each pixel block represents a 10x10 pixel area, and users can purchase these blocks by minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that they can customize with images and other details.

This project pays homage to the infamous [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/).
